# Active Development Context

## Current Focus:
Working through Task 1: Resolve inconsistencies in CLINE/RooCode setup documentation.

## Recent Changes:
- Read all `.clinerules-*` files to get full context.
- Updated `tasks/tasks_plan.md` to include task for reviewing `.clinerules` and marked task 8 as complete.

## Findings for Task 1.1 (CLINE Rule Loading):
- Based on `README.md` and user prompt, the current effective method involves:
    - `.clinerules` file at root (potentially for base context).
    - Manual copy-paste of content from `clinerules/plan`, `clinerules/implement`, `clinerules/debug` into Cline extension settings for mode-specific rules.

## Findings for Task 1.2 (RooCode Rule Loading):
- Based on `README.md` and file structure, the intended method involves:
    - `.clinerules` file at root.
    - Mode-specific files (`.clinerules-architect`, `.clinerules-code`, `.clinerules-debug`) at root. RooCode likely loads the relevant file based on the active mode.
    - Note: Discrepancy between README (`plan`/`act`) and actual file names (`architect`/`code`).

## Task 1.3 Update:
- Updated `README.md` to:
    - Correct RooCode mode filenames (`architect`/`code` instead of `plan`/`act`).
    - Clarify CLINE setup requires manual copy-paste for detailed mode rules.
    - Refine description of `.clinerules` usage across platforms.

## Task 1.4 Update:
- Reviewed `.clinerules` file. Initially decided no updates were needed.
- **Revision based on user feedback:** Updated `.clinerules` to add a section clarifying intended mode-specific rules and the Cline workaround/bug. Used `@` prefix for consistency and removed backticks.
- **Task 1 (Resolve inconsistencies in CLINE/RooCode setup documentation) is now complete.**

## Additional Updates:
- Documented the Cline UI bug in `docs/technical.md`.
- Updated `tasks/tasks_plan.md` to mark task 8 complete and add task 9 for reviewing `.clinerules`.

## Task 2 Update:
- Added a "Rule Loading Summary" table to `README.md` summarizing the mechanism for each platform (Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, Windsurf), including file locations, names, and notes on loading (e.g., manual copy for Cline, Cline UI bug).
- **Note:** Windsurf information in the table is provisional and needs verification (tracked in Task 2.3).
- **Task 2 (Clarify and document the definitive rule loading mechanism for each platform) is now in progress (pending Task 2.3).**

## Task 5.1 Update:
- Used `tools/search_engine.py` to determine that Windsurf uses a `.windsurfrules` file in the project root.
- Determined the likely purpose of the file.
- **Note:** The exact format and content of the `.windsurfrules` file still need to be verified. The file has not been created yet.
